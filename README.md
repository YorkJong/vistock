# vistock
vistock is an open source package that provides a lot of plot() function to visualizing stocks. For those who just want to use it directly without knowing too many details, I also provide a Colab notebook file, which can be used to plot the stock chart you want after simply filling out the forms of parameters.

## Getting Started on Colab

1. Click [vistock_demo.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YorkJong/vistock/blob/main/examples/vistock_demo.ipynb) to open it in Colab.
2. Sign in your Google account if required.
3. Follow the movies below.

## Install

### Install vistock from GitHub
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/YorkJong/vistock.git
```

### Install TA-Lib optionally (used only by vistock.mpl.rsi module)
